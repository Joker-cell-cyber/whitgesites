You might be required to provide information in some places of this Website in order for you to benefit from specific features (such newsletter subscriptions, tips/pointers, order processing) or to take part in a specific activity (such as other promotions).

    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
      <li>As necessary for the provision of services, responses to your requests, fulfillment of your orders, as well as delivery of publications and promotional communications, and to enhance your experience on our website.

    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-400 to-purple-400">Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information</h2>
    <p>${COMPANY.serviceName} processes personal information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, as described above. Our legal basis to process personal information includes processing that is:</p>
    
    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
      <li>Necessary for the performance of the contract between ${COMPANY.serviceName} and you (e.g., to provide you with the services you request and to identify and authenticate you);</li>
      <li>Necessary to comply with legal requirements (e.g., to comply with applicable accounting rules and to make mandatory disclosures to law enforcement);</li>
      <li>Necessary for our legitimate interests (e.g., to manage our relationship with you, to improve the website and our services, to fight frauds, and to protect our rights);</li>
      <li>Based on your consent (e.g., marketing, Cookies, tracking technologies)</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p class="mt-4">EU Privacy laws recognize certain interests as "legitimate" without requiring further justification. This includes the use of personal information toâ€”</p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
      <li>Prevent or investigate possible misconduct or fraud.</li>
      <li>Prevent or investigate potential criminal acts.</li>
      <li>Enhance verification of product use to comply with licensing terms</li>
      <li>Comply with legal disclosure requirements</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Where legitimate interest is the legal basis for processing of personal information, ${COMPANY.serviceName} will balance the legitimate interest pursued by us and any relevant third party with your interest and fundamental rights and freedoms in relation to the protection of your personal information to ensure it is appropriate to rely on legitimate interest and to identify any additional steps we need to take to achieve the right balance.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">${COMPANY.serviceName} also maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable laws and federal standards to secure your non-public personal information.
