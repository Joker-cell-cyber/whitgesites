    <p>In the same way that many websites do, this Website actively collects information from its users by asking specific questions and by allowing you to get in touch with us directly via email and/or feedback forms. There's a chance that some of the data you provide will be personally identifiable (that is, information that can be uniquely identified with you, such as your full name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number and sales delivery, billing and credit card information). You might be required to provide information in some places of this Website in order for you to benefit from specific features (such newsletter subscriptions, tips/pointers, order processing) or to take part in a specific activity (such as other promotions). What information is necessary and what information is optional will be made clear to you at each point where information is collected.</p>

    <p>This website automatically collects certain information about you and your computer when you browse it. For instance, this website will collect your IP address, web browser software (such as Chrome, Safari, or Internet Explorer), and the referring website. Our goal in collecting this automatic information is to better understand how our customers use our website. Your IP address is also used to help identify you and to gather demographic information about you. Finally we use your IP address to help prevent fraud and to diagnose problems with our server.</p>

  <section>
    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-400 to-purple-400">Information Collection from Outside Sources</h2>
    <p>This website may also occasionally collect information about you from other sources, such as when someone else refers you to our website or when you use a service on the website that is operated by a third party. Information that may be gathered from third parties includes information about services delivered, your use of the services, and demographic information.</p>
    <p>If your name can be linked to your non-public personal information (information that can be used to identify you, such as your email address, home address, phone number, or name), ${COMPANY.serviceName} treats the information in compliance with its privacy policy.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-400 to-purple-400">Personal Information and Third Parties</h2>
    <p>${COMPANY.serviceName} does not share your non-public personal information with unauthorized third parties. This website authorizes the sharing of such information only with employees and authorized service providers who assist ${COMPANY.serviceName} in business operations.</p>
    
    <p class="mt-4">${COMPANY.serviceName} may share your non-public personal information for the following purposes:</p>
    
    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
      <li>As necessary for the provision of services, responses to your requests, fulfillment of your orders, as well as delivery of publications and promotional communications, and to enhance your experience on our website. For instance, ${COMPANY.serviceName} will share your information with third parties when you instruct us to or give us permission. Therefore, if you purchase an item from this website, we will share your credit card information with the credit card processor to verify, process and complete your transaction for the item, as well as your shipping and email address with the merchant who delivers your order.</li>
      <li>In the event ${COMPANY.serviceName} or its properties are acquired, your information may be transferred to the new owner.

  <section>
    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-400 to-purple-400">Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information</h2>
    <p>${COMPANY.serviceName} processes personal information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, as described above. Our legal basis to process personal information includes processing that is:</p>
    
    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
      <li>Necessary for the performance of the contract between ${COMPANY.serviceName} and you (e.g., to provide you with the services you request and to identify and authenticate you);</li>
      <li>Necessary to comply with legal requirements (e.g., to comply with applicable accounting rules and to make mandatory disclosures to law enforcement);</li>
      <li>Necessary for our legitimate interests (e.g., to manage our relationship with you, to improve the website and our services, to fight frauds, and to protect our rights);</li>
      <li>Based on your consent (e.g., marketing, Cookies, tracking technologies)</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p class="mt-4">EU Privacy laws recognize certain interests as "legitimate" without requiring further justification. This includes the use of personal information to—</p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
      <li>Prevent or investigate possible misconduct or fraud.</li>
      <li>Prevent or investigate potential criminal acts.</li>
      <li>Enhance verification of product use to comply with licensing terms</li>
      <li>Comply with legal disclosure requirements</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Where legitimate interest is the legal basis for processing of personal information, ${COMPANY.serviceName} will balance the legitimate interest pursued by us and any relevant third party with your interest and fundamental rights and freedoms in relation to the protection of your personal information to ensure it is appropriate to rely on legitimate interest and to identify any additional steps we need to take to achieve the right balance.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-400 to-purple-400">Protection of Data</h2>
    <p>${COMPANY.serviceName} attempts to protect your personal information by requiring that all employees who have access to or are associated with the processing of your personal information respect your confidentiality, by restricting access to non-public information about you to the employees who need to know the information to assist you.</p>
    
    <p class="mt-4">${COMPANY.serviceName} also maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable laws and federal standards to secure your non-public personal information. The security of your personal information is important to us, and ${COMPANY.serviceName} strives to implement and maintain reasonable, commercially acceptable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information we store, in order to protect it from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and we are unable to guarantee the absolute security of the personal information we have collected from you.</p>
