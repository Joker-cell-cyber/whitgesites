<h2>Passive Information Collection</h2>

<p>Using a variety of technologies and methods, including Internet Protocol addresses, cookies, Internet tags, and navigational data collecting, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without you actively submitting the information) while you navigate through a website. The Internet Protocol (IP) addresses may be used on this Website.</p>

<p>Because an IP address is typically dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user's computer), it is generally regarded as non-personally identifiable information. An IP address is a number that your Internet service provider assigns to your computer so you can access the Internet. Your IP address is used by us to administer and enhance customer services, report aggregate data, identify the quickest connection path for your computer to use while connecting to our Website, and identify issues with our server.</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>

<p>To aid in preventing unauthorized access and maintaining data security, we have implemented specific physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. Secure 256-bit SSL Encryption is used to process payments. Credit card information and other personal information will not be traded, sold, or shared with any third-party service providers.</p>

<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>This privacy statement might change over time. Whenever we make any significant changes to this Privacy Policy, we'll send you a notification through email to the email address connected to your account. You can notify us by letter or by email if you do not agree with the modified version (for instance, if you object to how we now plan to use your personal information). If you don't object in writing, we'll assume that you're okay with the Privacy Policy's modifications. Except as may be required by law, changes won't apply retroactively to personal data that was collected before the modifications to the Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>Privacy of the very young needs to be protected in particular. Under the age of 18 users are not permitted on this website. No portion of our website is intended to appeal to anybody under the age of 18, and we never collect or keep information at the website from users we know to be under 18. We advise parents to have a conversation with their kids about how they use the Internet and the data they disclose and give out to websites.</p>
